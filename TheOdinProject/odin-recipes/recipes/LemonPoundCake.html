        <h2>For lemon drizzle:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>▢1 cup (120 g) powdered/icing sugar, sifted</li>
            <li>▢6 - 7 tsp lemon juice (freshly squeezed)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 355 ºF (180 ºC) and line a loaf baking tin with greaseproof/baking paper.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the gluten free flour blend, almond flour, xanthan gum, and baking powder. Add the sugar and salt, and mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the softened butter and work it into the dry ingredients until you get a texture resembling coarse breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon zest. In a separate bowl, mix together the eggs, milk, vanilla, and lemon juice. Add the wet ingredients to the dry+butter mixture, and whisk until no flour clumps remain.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cake batter into the prepared loaf tin, smooth out the top, and bake for about 1 hour or until risen and golden brown.</li>
            <li>If the cake starts browning too quickly, cover it with aluminum foil and continue baking until done.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool in the loaf tin for about 10 minutes, then remove from the tin and cool completely on a rack.</li>
        </ol>
